# **2nd** march


sckitlearn video 30 completed today
datacamp course on machine learning start today,2 topics 
covered:
study about bin in seaborn(means it default value 
which is 10 is changed and see the effect)
list at evening start in datacamp
numerical EDA
we will explore more 
om shanti


# 3rd march


time table:
datacamp course is to be completed now from python to
machine learning
then we will think what to do 
next


# 8th march


hello git
and om shanti omshanti 
today i have started course on statistical learning, refered by dataschool and shubham kalani(mail has 
been sent by him and book has by him)
and that datacamp course is continue...
refered by navin,and then in evening
i talked to parmod sir , he have told me 
three to four thing to do:
1. data mining by camber(book)
2. acm membership
3. spark framework (he have said that 
one framework has to be selected,
to process large data)
4. and then hackathon idea(they have 
suggested energy consumption, every one is talking about smart india , smart city ).
5. discussed about how backhend code can be taken by website(git hub suggested by 
jatin khemchandani)
6.  workshop by vimal daga (on artifical
intelligence where the main point is 
that u have to use more than one technologies to build up project on machine learning like cloud or bigdata which is suggest by pramod sir about spark)
7. pandas can be learn through wesmckineey
git hub repositry his pandas video was
fantastic, and he sequence wise explain 
where he have there are many things to learn like matplotlib, skitimage and many more....
8. and one course start by microsoft
on machine learning which is on R
don't ignore it
site name:
take it from keshav asopa
9. 
vimal daga http://52.203.32.198/
has given id where machine learnig model

**learning markdown language**

[link to google](http://google.com)

sometime you want bullet points:

* start a line with star

Alternatively,
- dashes work just as well, for adding subpoints
put two spaces
  - like this
  - and this

if you want to add images

![image of github](https://www.google.co.in/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fassets-cdn.github.com%2Fimages%2Fmodules%2Fopen_graph%2Fgithub-mark.png&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2F&docid=SZgkdCZ5k2vZ_M&tbnid=5cWNHtEIveYFNM%3A&vet=10ahUKEwid3LzeoYzaAhVFrI8KHahlDy4QMwg0KAAwAA..i&w=1200&h=630&bih=820&biw=701&q=image%20for%20github&ved=0ahUKEwid3LzeoYzaAhVFrI8KHahlDy4QMwg0KAAwAA&iact=mrc&uact=8)

some time it is useful to have different levels start line with `#`

**if you have to write the code**

    if (isAwesome){
	return true
    }


GitHub also support somethin called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:

```

if (isAwsemo){
	return true
}

```

and if you'd like to use syntax highlighting,iclude the language

```javascript

if (isAwsemo){
	return true
}

```

But I have to admit, tasks lists are my favorite:
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item

And, of course emoji@! :sparkles: :camel: :boom:

*this text will be italic*

_this text willbe italic_

_you **can** combine them_

# unordered list

* item 1

* item 2
  * item 2a
  * item 2b

you can write code your code by four spaces

    function fancy(arg){
        if(arg){
 
        }
    }


    def foo():
        if not bar:
            return true

# Tables

# 30 march

one video on edureka about ai vs deeplearning vs machine learning

link is [link of ai vs deeplearning vs artificial intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSbgixdC9g8)

# 31st march

**plan of tommorrow**

i will wake up early at morning, and continue that project of machine learning

- [ ] project on machine learning which is titanic shipmember we have to predict which person survive or not

# first of all that has to be completed

## than sentiment analysis project where you have to learn tweepy and twitter api system  continue course on machine learning by andrewng or intro to machine learning

31st march

Recommendation(unsupervised):
Netflix(started in hackathon)

Application of machine learning:

training data set and validation and test dataset:
validation(works fine or not) and testing

d3not.js(for front hand purpose)
 
deep learning :
speech recognization

voice recognization ( or speech recognization )
easy way to detect it 

speech to text
speaker recognization( by microsoft azure)

2nd April
workshop on ai and machine learning

Rajat (experience of 25 years in it sector):
cloud computing:
The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on internet to store, manage, and process data .

cloud examples in reallife:
icloud , dropbox , google drive and many more

why use cloud computingL
Classification of cloud-deployment and access
private cloud
public cloud(Goggle App Engine)
hybrid cloud( takes advantage of scalability and cost-effeciveness of a public cloud)

classification of cloud-Delivery models:

user Level ("software as a service")

Developer Level("platform as a service")

IT level( "infrastructure as as service")

service Delivery models

using cloud as a service

what the number say ( growth in cloud industry graph)

it budgets of cloud investment

business of cloud computing( 74% marketing)

# Artifical Intelligence

 iot(Network of connected device)
 **examples** : street light will glow on the basis of movement,smartcity concept, to search citizen digitally

 in 60second millions of data is genrating ( we make to use of that)

World map of sociall network( Fcebook, ozone)

50 billion will be connected to internet in 2020

technology that used deep natural language processing 

examples : chat bot machine, cortona, google assistant, siri

machine learning( learn from data or past experience and predict output)

environment  with a high deegree of complexity are where machine learning is most useful

what is neural network:

computing system inspired by the bioloical neural networks that constitute animal brains 

input layer - hidden layer - output layer

Neural network are a means of doing machine learning.

speech recognization on smartphone, google's latest automatic translator are on basis of neural network

siri,cortona,alexa, facebook

google tensor flow canbe used for ai purpose

Dnn research(use of deep learning)(Google)


# the area where it is used mostly
high tech / telecom
automotive assembly 
financial services
