**learning markdown language**

[link to google](http://google.com)

sometime you want bullet points:

* start a line with star

Alternatively,
- dashes work just as well, for adding subpoints
put two spaces
  - like this
  - and this

if you want to add images

![image of github](https://www.google.co.in/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fassets-cdn.github.com%2Fimages%2Fmodules%2Fopen_graph%2Fgithub-mark.png&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2F&docid=SZgkdCZ5k2vZ_M&tbnid=5cWNHtEIveYFNM%3A&vet=10ahUKEwid3LzeoYzaAhVFrI8KHahlDy4QMwg0KAAwAA..i&w=1200&h=630&bih=820&biw=701&q=image%20for%20github&ved=0ahUKEwid3LzeoYzaAhVFrI8KHahlDy4QMwg0KAAwAA&iact=mrc&uact=8)

some time it is useful to have different levels start line with `#`

**if you have to write the code**

    if (isAwesome){
	return true
    }


GitHub also support somethin called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:

```

if (isAwsemo){
	return true
}

```

and if you'd like to use syntax highlighting,iclude the language

```javascript

if (isAwsemo){
	return true
}

```

But I have to admit, tasks lists are my favorite:
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item

And, of course emoji@! :sparkles: :camel: :boom:

*this text will be italic*

_this text willbe italic_

_you **can** combine them_

# unordered list

* item 1

* item 2
  * item 2a
  * item 2b

you can write code your code by four spaces

    function fancy(arg){
        if(arg){
 
        }
    }


    def foo():
        if not bar:
            return true

# Tables
