sometime you want bullet points:

* start a line with star

Alternatively,
- dashes work just as well, for adding subpoints
put two spaces
  - like this
  - and this

if you want to add images

some time it is useful to have different levels start line with `#`

** if you have to write the code **

    if (isAwesome){
	return true
    }


GitHub also support somethin called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:

```

if (isAwsemo){
	return true
}

```

and if you'd like to use syntax highlighting,iclude the language

```javascript

if (isAwsemo){
	return true
}

```

But I have to admit, tasks lists are my favorite:
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item

And, of course emoji@! :sparkles: :camel: :boom:
